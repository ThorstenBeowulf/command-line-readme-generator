# Command Line Readme Generator

## Description

A simple app to generate a readme file in markdown. When run in the command line, a series of prompts are asked which are then used to fill out a readme template and then create the file in the local directory.

## How to use

- Run ``` node index.js ``` in a CLI
- Answer the text prompts
- Select a license
- When finished, a README.md file will be created in the same folder as index.js with the responses you gave
